📂 File Storage & Sharing App

A serverless web application that allows users to securely upload, store, and share files using AWS cloud services.
This project demonstrates the integration of S3, Lambda, API Gateway, and Cognito to build a scalable and secure file management system.

🚀 Project Overview

Objective:
To build a cloud-based file storage system that enables users to upload, list, and download files securely.

Core Idea:

Store files on AWS S3.

Manage uploads and downloads through Lambda functions.

Expose endpoints using API Gateway.

Optionally use Cognito for authentication.

🧠 Features

✅ Upload files securely to AWS S3
✅ View the list of uploaded files
✅ Download files using pre-signed URLs
✅ Serverless backend using AWS Lambda
✅ RESTful API via AWS API Gateway
✅ Optional user login with AWS Cognito

🏗 Architecture Workflow

User selects a file from their device.

File is sent to the backend via API Gateway.

The request triggers an AWS Lambda function.

Lambda uploads the file to an S3 bucket.

Users can view or download files using pre-signed URLs generated by Lambda.

🛠 Technologies Used
Service	Purpose
AWS S3	Secure file storage
AWS Lambda	Serverless backend logic
AWS API Gateway	REST API endpoints
AWS Cognito (optional)	Authentication
HTML / CSS / JavaScript	Frontend interface
⚙ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/file-storage-sharing-app.git
cd file-storage-sharing-app

2. Configure AWS Services

Create an S3 bucket and note its name.

Set up AWS Lambda functions for:

uploadFile

listFiles

generateDownloadLink

Create an API Gateway with routes:

POST /upload

GET /files

GET /download

(Optional) Integrate Cognito for authentication.

3. Frontend Setup

Edit the API endpoints in your frontend JavaScript file:

const API_BASE_URL = "https://your-api-gateway-url.amazonaws.com/prod";

4. Run the Project

Open the index.html file in your browser or deploy it to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS Amplify.
