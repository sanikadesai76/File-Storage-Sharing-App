📂 File Storage & Sharing App

A serverless web application that allows users to securely upload, store, and share files using AWS cloud services.
This project demonstrates the integration of S3, Lambda, API Gateway, and Cognito to build a scalable and secure file management system.

🚀 Project Overview

Objective:
To build a cloud-based file storage system that enables users to upload, list, and download files securely.

Core Idea:

Store files on AWS S3.

Manage uploads and downloads through Lambda functions.

Expose endpoints using API Gateway.

Optionally use Cognito for authentication.

🧠 Features

✅ Upload files securely to AWS S3
✅ View the list of uploaded files
✅ Download files using pre-signed URLs
✅ Serverless backend using AWS Lambda
✅ RESTful API via AWS API Gateway
✅ Optional user login with AWS Cognito

🏗 Architecture Workflow

User selects a file from their device.

File is sent to the backend via API Gateway.

The request triggers an AWS Lambda function.

Lambda uploads the file to an S3 bucket.

Users can view or download files using pre-signed URLs generated by Lambda.
